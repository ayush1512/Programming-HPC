OpenMP
1.	Write OpenMP program that creates 10 tasks. Each task should print the thread number of the calling thread.
Change the number of threads using omp_set_num_threads() or OMP_NUM_THREADS
2.	Write a parallel program to find sum of an array	

Remove reduction and see what happens (Hint: data race).
Use omp_get_thread_num() to print which thread handles which iterations.

3.	Write an Openmp program to compute PI

4. 	Write a program for Matrix and vector multiplication.
